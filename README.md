17x7 pixels of single-colour, brightness-controlled, message scrolling goodness!

It is a FORK from https://github.com/pimoroni/scroll-phat-hd

I bought a scroll bot https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/scroll-bot-pi-zero-w-project-kit

I transform the code to adapt to scroll bot. I focused to web-api in Flask. To control screen over http.

All code has:
```
scrollphathd.rotate(degrees=180)scrollphathd.rotate(degrees=180)
```
